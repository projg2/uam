# Whether to try to remount fs R/O if umount fails.

UMOUNT_TRY_RO=1

# Whether to engage an lazy-umount if umount fails.

# Whether to remove created mountpoints after umount or mount failure.

REMOVE_MOUNTPOINTS=1

# Whether to search for and remove unused mountpoints when we receive umount
# request for non-mounted (already unmounted?) device.

CLEANUP_ALLOW=1

# How deep to search for unused mountpoints under ${MOUNTPOINT_BASE}.
# 0 means to look only directly under ${MOUNTPOINT_BASE}, 1 to look in its'
# subdirectories etc. If not set, we try to count slashes in
# ${MOUNTPOINT_TEMPLATES}.

# CLEANUP_MAXDEPTH=0

# Whether we should stay on the same filesystem when searching for unused
# mounpoints (to avoid reading through floppies, CDs etc.). If you use
# mountpoints on a different filesystem than ${MOUNTPOINT_BASE} and you want to
# cleanup them too, set this to false.

CLEANUP_XDEV=1

# Whether to search for and remove symlinks to removed mountpoints.

CLEANUP_SYMLINKS=1

# 'Array' of possible mountpoint name templates to use (uam will use first free).
# Can contain pathnames relative to ${MOUNTPOINT_BASE}. If you'd like to use
# absolute pathnames here, just set MOUNTPOINT_BASE=''.
#
# You can use any environment variable provided by udev, including:
#	${ID_FS_TYPE}		for fs type (ext2, swap, vfat, etc.)
#	${ID_FS_UUID_ENC}	for fs UUID (unique identifier)
#	${ID_FS_LABEL_ENC}	for fs label (user-specified)
# Below will work only under real udev, not when launched manually:
#	${ID_SERIAL}		for full serial of device (incl. vendor, model and inst)
#	${ID_SERIAL_SHORT}	for actual serial of device
# You can also use the following additional uam-specific vars:
#	${DEVBASENAME}		to get basename of the device (i.e. sda1)
#	${PARTN}			partition number (i.e. 1)
#	${SERIAL}			like ${ID_SERIAL}, but without the instance
# If you would like to lookup these for a specific device, please call:
#	/sbin/blkid -o udev /dev/sdXY
# or (with older udev):
#	/lib/udev/vol_id /dev/sdXY
#
# If your /bin/sh points to bash you might also use standard bash array below.
# Simply change the single quotes below to parentheses and everything should
# work fine. Please notice that due to the nature of processing array variables,
# real bash arrays need to be 'directly' interpolated by bash while
# pseudo-arrays have to be quoted to prevent variable interpolation.
